# Shannon Pixel Modem Tweaks

This is a Jetpack Compose Android app written in Kotlin to provide a user-friendly interface for applying modem tweaks to rooted devices for network testing.

> **Warning**
>
> Applying changes to your modem could cause your device to breach local regulations regarding radio frequency emissions.
>
> You must conduct your own research into changes and local laws and regulations before performing any changes.
>
> This may also invalidate your device's warranty.

## Tweaks

This app allows the application of nvitem tweaks from my [Shannon nvitem enabler scripts repository](https://github.com/davwheat/shannon-pixel-modem-nvitem-enabler-scripts).

A huge thanks goes to Lightspeed and Ameli√© for their work on Shannon modem tinkering, including discovering nvitem modding, confseqs and more.
